// To combine streaming or buffering with goroutines, you can use a similar approach as before, but with some modifications to handle the streaming/buffering. Here's an example of how you can modify the code to download the .ts files concurrently, combine them, and stream or buffer the result:

package main

import (
	"io"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"sync"
)

const (
	maxConcurrency = 10 // maximum number of concurrent downloads
	bufferSize     = 10 // size of the buffer for streaming/buffering
)

func main() {
	urls := []string{ // list of URLs for .ts files
		"http://example.com/1.ts",
		"http://example.com/2.ts",
		"http://example.com/3.ts",
		// ...
	}

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	semaphore := make(chan struct{}, maxConcurrency)
	dataChan := make(chan []byte, bufferSize)

	// launch a goroutine for each .ts file
	for _, url := range urls {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(url string) {
			defer wg.Done()

			// acquire a semaphore before downloading
			semaphore <- struct{}{}
			defer func() { <-semaphore }()

			resp, err := http.Get(url)
			if err != nil {
				log.Fatal(err)
			}
			defer resp.Body.Close()

			data, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
			if err != nil {
				log.Fatal(err)
			}

			// send the downloaded data to the channel
			dataChan <- data
		}(url)
	}

	// wait for all downloads to finish
	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		close(dataChan)
	}()

	// create the output file
	outputFile, err := os.Create("output.ts")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer outputFile.Close()

	// read the downloaded data from the channel and write it to the output file
	for data := range dataChan {
		_, err = outputFile.Write(data)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
	}
}

// In this modified version of the code, we use a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent downloads to maxConcurrency, which can help prevent memory or network congestion. We also use a buffered channel to allow for streaming or buffering of the combined data.

// When a .ts file is downloaded, we acquire a semaphore before downloading, and release it after downloading. This ensures that we don't download too many files at once. After all files are downloaded, we close the dataChan channel to signal that all downloads are complete.

// Finally, we read the downloaded data from the dataChan channel and write it to the output file. Since dataChan is buffered, we can use a loop to read from the channel and write to the file in chunks, allowing for streaming or buffering.
